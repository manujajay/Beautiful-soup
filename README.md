# BeautifulSoup

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and examples on using BeautifulSoup, a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It offers simple methods for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, making it ideal for web scraping.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

## Installation

To get started with BeautifulSoup, you first need to install it along with a parser library:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml  # lxml is one of the parsers that can be used with BeautifulSoup
```

## Example - Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

This example demonstrates how to scrape data from a simple HTML page:

### `scrape_example.py`

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Sample HTML content
html_content = '''
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a Test</h1>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
</body>
</html>
'''

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'lxml')

# Access the title of the page
title = soup.find('title').text
print("Title of the page:", title)

# Access the text of the h1 tag
h1_text = soup.find('h1').text
print("Text in h1 tag:", h1_text)
```
